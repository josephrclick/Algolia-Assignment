Algolia Solutions Engineer Take Home Assignment - November 2024

I intended to create a simple front end to facilitate searching for a movie to purchase with a focus on providing visitors value by emphasizing titles currently on sale. Users can toggle to view only titles currently On Sale, and search ranking and sorting prioritizes Featured titles, then titles On Sale. I included a Genre facet and considered adding Popularity or Price sliders but at risk of over-engineering, I kept the interface simple for this exercise.

I chose to bootstrap an InstantSearch.js app as that documentation was so comprehensive. I modified the hits output to be more user friendly, including slicing the first 3 actors from the Actors object via JavaScript. I tweaked the banner color and some other CSS values, added the PoweredBy Algolia widget and facets to hopefully show I am savvy enough to work with the coding needed to implement the front end.

This was a great exercise and I must commend you for your most excellent documentation and user experience working with your platform. The UI is top-notch and attention to detail is everywhere, like docs automatically populating API and App IDs where applicable throughout the documentation based on the Application I was configuring. I found no broken links or anything I'd recommend changing in your documentation. Very impressive!
